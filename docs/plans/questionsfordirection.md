# Questions for Direction

*A focused document to clarify The Garden Fence’s vision and prevent scope creep.*

---

## Section 1: The Core "Why"

### 1.1 The Frustration

**What specific frustration with existing tools made you start building this?**

Existing tools assume consistent attention, linear planning, and discipline. I plan optimistically, lose track of time, forget longer-term goals, and then feel guilty when everything collapses. I needed something visual that makes time passing obvious and keeps long-term goals visible without pressure.

---

### 1.2 The Alternative

**If this app didn't exist, what would you use instead? What's wrong with that option?**

I would use TickTick or a paper planner, but both fail when time stretches or compresses. They don’t help me feel where I am in time or keep longer-term goals present in daily life.

---

### 1.3 The One Thing

**In one sentence, what does this app do that nothing else does?**

It makes time visible across day, week, month, and year while gently tying daily actions to longer-term goals.

---

### 1.4 The Name Test

**"The Garden Fence" – does this name still feel right?**

The metaphor feels right, but the name may be misleading or too abstract. The emotional tone matters more than the literal name, and this can be revisited later.

---

### 1.5 The Elevator Pitch

**If someone asked "what's The Garden Fence?" in an elevator, what would you say?**

It’s a visual planning tool that helps people with time blindness stay oriented, grounded, and connected to what matters over time.

---

## Section 2: Your One User

### 2.1 Who, Specifically?

**Describe the ONE person this app is for.**

An adult with ADHD or time blindness who wants to stay oriented and organized without turning productivity into a full-time job. This is a utility, not a lifestyle app.

---

### 2.2 Their Day

**What does a typical day look like? What goes wrong?**

Time slips by unnoticed. They either hyperfocus on the wrong thing or avoid starting altogether. By evening, they feel behind and disconnected from their real priorities.

---

### 2.3 Their Current Tools

**What apps/systems is this person currently using? What do they hate about them?**

A mix of task apps, notes, planners, and scraps of paper. They hate maintaining systems more than doing the work itself.

---

### 2.4 Their Moment of Need

**At what specific moment in their day would they open The Garden Fence?**

At the start of the day to orient themselves, during the day to re-orient, and at night to see tomorrow without anxiety.

---

### 2.5 Their Win

**What does success look like for this person after using the app for a week?**

They feel more aware of time passing, less surprised by deadlines, and more connected to what they actually care about.

---

### 2.6 Not Your User

**Who is this app explicitly NOT for?**

People who enjoy deep customization, heavy analytics, gamified productivity, or spending hours optimizing systems.

---

## Section 3: The Minimum Viable Garden

### 3.1 The Core Loop

**What's the ONE action a user should do in this app every day?**

Open the app and re-orient themselves in time.

---

### 3.2 The Three Features

**If you could only keep THREE features, which three?**

1. Visual time orientation across day, week, month, and year

2. Simple task and goal placement tied directly to time

3. Persistent visibility of longer-term goals

Optional support tools exist to help unblock the core loop, not replace it.

---

### 3.3 The Time Test

**Which views do you actually use yourself?**

* [x] Day
* [x] Month
* [x] Year
* [x] Week
* [x] Home

---

### 3.4 The Sync Question

**Is cloud sync essential for v1, or could you launch with local-only?**

Cloud sync is important to me to go from mobile to desktop with ease 

---

### 3.5 The Mobile Question

**Is mobile essential for v1, or could you launch desktop-only?**

Mobile is essential. Time orientation needs to work anywhere.

---

### 3.6 The Account Question

**Do users need accounts for v1, or could you launch without login?**

Users do not need accounts for v1. Login should be optional.

---

## Section 4: What to Kill

### 4.1 The Feature Graveyard

**List every feature you've thought about adding but haven't built yet.**

Social sharing, collaboration, coaching flows, AI planning, recommendations, habit tracking, journaling, analytics dashboards, public profiles, evidence journal.

---

### 4.2 The Cut List

**Which ones should NEVER be built?**

Social features, public profiles, competitive elements, heavy analytics.
Evidence journal is explicitly postponed until after long-term personal use confirms the need.
---

### 4.3 The Complexity Audit

**What's the most complex feature currently in the app? Is it worth the complexity?**

The multi-level goal hierarchy. It is worth keeping only if it stays visually simple and non-obligatory.

---

### 4.4 The Time Views

**Do you really need 5 different time views? Could you cut any?**

All five views are essential:
- **Home** — Essential (especially on mobile, the home base)
- **Day** — Essential (intention for today)
- **Week** — Essential (see the week ahead)
- **Month** — Essential (milestone context)
- **Year** — Essential (vision context)

---

### 4.5 The Garden Metaphor

**Is the garden/botanical theme helping or hurting?**

It helps emotionally but should remain subtle and non-distracting.

---

### 4.6 The Settings Audit

**How many settings does the app have? Could you hard-code most of them?**

There are too many settings. Most can be hard-coded with only essential accessibility overrides.

---

### 4.7 The Theme Complexity

**Is the theme system too complex?**

Yes. One dark theme and one light theme are sufficient for v1.

---

### 4.8 The Analytics Question

**Do you really need analytics/insights for v1?**

No.

---

### 4.9 The Streak Question

**Are streaks helping users or creating anxiety?**

Streaks are allowed only as low-pressure, weekly pattern indicators. They should never reset, never break, and never be framed as obligations. Their purpose is retrospective pride, not motivation through pressure.

---

### 4.10 The ND Support Features

**List all the neurodivergent support features. Which ones do you actually use?**

Optional tools include Brain Dump, Body Double, and Quick Wins. These are used situationally when stuck or overwhelmed, not as daily requirements. They live behind an optional tools menu and do not compete with the primary planning experience. Future tools like an Evidence Journal may be added only if they support emotional regulation without increasing daily cognitive load.

---

## Section 5: Decision Framework

### 5.1 The New Feature Test

**Complete this sentence: "I will only add a new feature if ____________."**

I will only add a new feature if it supports time orientation or emotional regulation without becoming something I feel obligated to use daily.

---

### 5.2 The Complexity Budget

* Current complexity: 8/10
* Target complexity: 5/10

---

### 5.3 The Time Budget

**How many hours per week can you realistically spend on this app?**

1–2 hours per week, limited to Fridays.

---

### 5.4 The Maintenance Test

**List features that fail this test.**

Features that require daily upkeep, manual review, or emotional performance tracking fail this test.

---

### 5.5 The "Hell Yes" Rule

**Agree?**

Yes.

---

## Section 6: Definition of Done

### 6.1 The Launch Criteria

**What MUST work perfectly before you'd tell 10 friends to try this app?**

I can reliably add, view, and reschedule tasks, understand where I am in time, and trust that my data will not disappear.

---

### 6.2 The Bug Tolerance

**What level of bugs is acceptable for v1?**

Minor visual bugs and some UX rough edges.

---

### 6.3 The Platform Priority

1. Desktop browser
2. Mobile browser
3. iOS PWA
4. Android PWA

---

### 6.4 The Offline Question

**Does offline mode need to work perfectly for v1?**

Offline should mostly work. Perfection is not required.

---

### 6.5 The Performance Bar

**What's the acceptable load time?**

Under 3 seconds.

---

### 6.6 The Documentation Question

**Do you need user documentation for v1?**

No. The app should be self-explanatory.

---

## Section 7: The Hard Questions

### 7.1 The Shipping Fear

**What's actually stopping you from shipping this tomorrow?**

Letting go of control and accepting “good enough.”

---

### 7.2 The Perfectionism Trap

**What are you perfecting that users don't care about?**

Visual polish and edge cases.

---

### 7.3 The Comparison Trap

**What app are you unconsciously comparing this to? Should you stop?**

Highly polished commercial productivity apps. Yes, I should stop.

---

### 7.4 The Scope Creep Pattern

**When you get excited about a new idea, what happens?**

I start building immediately.

---

### 7.5 The Time Sink

**In the last week, what did you spend the most time on?**

UI polish and animations. Not the most important thing.

---

### 7.6 The User Feedback

**Have you shown this to anyone outside yourself?**

Limited feedback so far, mostly emotionally resonant and positive.

---

### 7.7 The Done Question

**If you had to ship in 48 hours, what would you cut?**

I would cut visible access to optional tools and keep them behind a collapsed menu. The core app would remain usable without touching them.

---

## Section 8: Your Answers Summary

### The App in One Sentence

**The Garden Fence is a visual time-orientation tool for people with time blindness who want to stay grounded and organized without pressure.**

---

### The Three Essential Features

1. Visual time orientation
2. Simple task placement tied to time
3. Long-term goal visibility

---

### The Kill List

Streak resets
Analytics dashboards
Social features
Any tool that becomes mandatory rather than optional

---

### The V1 Definition

**V1 is ready when:**

* [ ] I can orient myself in time quickly
* [ ] I can add and see tasks without friction
