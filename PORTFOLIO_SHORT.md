## The Problem

Existing productivity tools assume consistent attention and linear planning. For people with ADHD and time blindness, this creates a cycle of optimistic planning, time loss, forgotten goals, and system collapse under maintenance overhead.

## The Solution

A visual time-orientation tool with three pillars:

1. **Multi-Scale Time Visualization** — Year/Month/Week/Day views with "You Are Here" context panel
2. **ADHD-Specific Features** — Focus Mode, Brain Dump, Body Double Timer, Quick Wins, Affirmations
3. **Hierarchical Goal System** — Vision → Milestone → Focus → Intention with visual linkage
