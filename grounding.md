# Grounding

*Read this before every work session.*

## The Vision

**The Garden Fence is a visual time-orientation tool for people with time blindness who want to stay grounded and organized without pressure.**

It makes time visible. It ties daily actions to longer-term goals. It does not demand anything.

**This is a utility, not a lifestyle app.**

---

## The One User

An adult with ADHD or time blindness who:
- Plans optimistically, loses track of time, forgets longer-term goals
- Hates maintaining systems more than doing the work itself
- Wants to feel oriented, not obligated
- Opens the app at the start of the day to orient, during the day to re-orient, and at night to see tomorrow without anxiety

**This app is NOT for:** People who enjoy deep customization, heavy analytics, gamified productivity, or spending hours optimizing systems.

## The Three Essentials

Everything else is optional. V1 needs only:

1. **Visual time orientation** — See where you are across day, week, month, year
2. **Simple task placement** — Add and see tasks tied directly to time
3. **Long-term goal visibility** — Keep bigger goals present without pressure

### Essential Views
- **Home** — Essential (especially on mobile, the home base)
- **Day** — Essential (intention for today)
- **Week** — Essential (see the week ahead)
- **Month** — Essential (milestone context)
- **Year** — Essential (vision context)

### The Hierarchy (Keep, Make Light)
- **Intention** (day) → **Focus** (week) → **Milestone** (month) → **Vision** (year)
- This structure is important but should never feel like obligation
- Show it, don't require it

## Decision Rules

Before adding anything, ask:

| Question | If Yes... |
|----------|-----------|
| Does it require daily maintenance? | **NO** |
| Does it create obligation or pressure? | **NO** |
| Does it increase cognitive load? | **NO** |
| Will I want to maintain this in 2 years? | If no, **NO** |
| Is it a "Hell yes!"? | If unsure, **NO** |

**The rule:** Only add features that reduce time blindness without increasing cognitive load. Optional tools are allowed only if they reduce overwhelm in the moment and can be ignored entirely.

## Stop Doing

These are not helping. Stop now:

- [ ] Endlessly polishing themes — Finish the fixes in themedeepdive.md, then stop
- [ ] Adding NEW features — Cut complexity from 8/10 to 5/10
- [ ] Perfecting edge cases — Users don't care
- [ ] Comparing to Notion/Todoist/TickTick — You are not them
- [ ] Building immediately when excited — Write it down, wait a week

**Note on themes:** The time-of-day theming supports the core vision (making time feel real). Finish the dark mode fixes outlined in themedeepdive.md. Then declare themes DONE and move on.

---

## V1 Is Done When

- [ ] I can orient myself in time quickly
- [ ] I can add and see tasks without friction
- [ ] The app feels calm, not demanding

**Bug tolerance:** Minor visual bugs and UX rough edges are acceptable.

**Performance bar:** Loads in under 3 seconds.

**Documentation:** None required. The app should be self-explanatory.

---

## What to Kill (Never Build)

- Streak resets or streak pressure
- Analytics dashboards
- Social features or public profiles
- Any tool that becomes mandatory
- Evidence journal (postponed until personal use confirms need)
- Heavy customization options (settings bloat)
- Gamification
- NEW theme variants (finish what exists, then stop)
- Affirmation section (clutter, cut entirely)
- Upcoming section (clutter, cut entirely — the garden shows what's current)

### Keep for Now, Improve Later
- Brain Dump, Body Double, Quick Wins — keep behind optional menu
- Garden bloom visualization — keep as is, reevaluate later

---

## The Honest Truth

**What's actually stopping you from shipping?**
> Letting go of control and accepting "good enough."

**What are you perfecting that users don't care about?**
> Visual polish and edge cases.

**If you had to ship in 48 hours, what would you cut?**
> Optional tools — collapse them behind a menu. The core works without them.

## Friday Ritual

You have 1-2 hours on Fridays. Use this format:

### Before Starting (2 min)
- [ ] Read this document
- [ ] Check: Am I about to work on something essential?

### During Work
- If you think of a new feature: Write it down, don't build it
- If you're polishing: Stop. Is it essential?
- If you're stuck: Ship what works, note what doesn't

### Before Closing (5 min)
- [ ] What did I actually work on?
- [ ] Was it one of the Three Essentials?
- [ ] What's the ONE thing for next Friday?

## Mantras

When in doubt, return to these:

> "A utility, not a lifestyle app."

> "Open the app and re-orient themselves in time."

> "Reduce time blindness without increasing cognitive load."

> "The garden doesn't need to be perfect to grow."

*Shipping something imperfect that helps one person is better than perfecting something forever that helps no one.*
